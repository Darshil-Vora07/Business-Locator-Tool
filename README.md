Summary:
The Business Locator Tool comprises three main functions:

FindBusinessBasedOnCity(cityToSearch, saveLocation1, collection): Identifies all businesses in the specified city and saves their details in a structured format.
FindBusinessBasedOnLocation(categoriesToSearch, myLocation, maxDistance, saveLocation2, collection): Finds businesses within a specified distance from a given location, based on categories.
DistanceFunction(startLatitude, startLongitude, endLatitude, endLongitude): Calculates the geographical distance between two points using the Haversine formula.


Installation:
No additional installation required for Python standard libraries. For running the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have Jupyter installed or use Google Colab.

Reflections and Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:

Data storage and processing using Python.
Geographical data analysis with the Haversine formula.
Problem-solving in data management and retrieval.
Utilizing Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and testing.


Results:
The project successfully identifies businesses based on city or proximity, showcasing the practical application of geographical data analysis and Python programming in solving real-world problems.
